## Tekton CRDs backup
# This file intentionally contains references and instructions to re-install
# the Tekton CustomResourceDefinitions (CRDs). The CRD definitions were
# removed from the main Tekton manifests to avoid ArgoCD continuously
# reconciling cluster-scoped CRDs. Install CRDs once using one of the
# options below.

# Recommended (use upstream release - run once):
## kubectl apply -f https://storage.googleapis.com/tekton-releases/pipeline/latest/release.yaml
## kubectl apply -f https://storage.googleapis.com/tekton-releases/triggers/latest/release.yaml

# If you want to keep an offline/checked-in copy of CRDs, you can generate
# the CRD YAML from the release and save here. For brevity this file does not
# include the full CRD documents; use the upstream release or export them
# from your cluster (kubectl get crd -o yaml > tekton-crds-backup.yaml).

# Example list of Tekton CRDs that were removed from the repo (informational):
# - customruns.tekton.dev
# - pipelines.tekton.dev
# - pipelineruns.tekton.dev
# - tasks.tekton.dev
# - taskruns.tekton.dev
# - stepactions.tekton.dev
# - resolutionrequests.resolution.tekton.dev
# - verificationpolicies.tekton.dev
# - (and other tekton.* and triggers.* CRDs)

# To export CRDs from a cluster that already has Tekton installed:
# kubectl get crd customruns.tekton.dev pipelines.tekton.dev pipelineruns.tekton.dev tasks.tekton.dev taskruns.tekton.dev -o yaml > tekton-crds-backup.yaml

# To apply the CRDs from this backup (if you populate them here):
# kubectl apply -f k8s/tekton/tekton-crds-backup.yaml

# Notes:
# - Only apply CRDs once (bootstrap). Do not keep managing them in an
#   app that is continuously reconciled by ArgoCD, unless you intentionally
#   manage CRDs with a separate ArgoCD Application.

# Backup of Tekton CRD-containing manifests
# This file is a repository-level backup copy of the original Tekton manifests
# that included CustomResourceDefinition documents. It was created so that the
# CRD documents can be removed from the continuously-synced ArgoCD app while
# preserving a copy in the repo for reference or re-application by cluster
# administrators.
#
# Source files concatenated below: tekton-pipelines-noncrd.yaml and tekton-dashboard.yaml

# Note: Full original file is preserved in repository history as well. If you
# need the exact CRD blocks re-applied, use this backup file or the original
# file `tekton/tekton-pipelines-noncrd.yaml` which still exists in this branch
# (copy kept here for convenience).
